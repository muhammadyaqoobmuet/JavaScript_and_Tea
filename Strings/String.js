 // In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. There is no separate type for a single character.
 // Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks:
 // Strings are immutable in JS
let single = 'single-quoted';
let double = "double-quoted";
let backticks = `backticks`;
// advantage of using backticks is that they allow a string to span multiple lines:
let guestList = `Guests:
 * John
 * Pete
 * Mary
`;

// ACSESSING CHARCTER BY INDEX a
single[0]='h'
console.log(single[0]); // this is first index and lastindex = length-1;
console.log(1);
// another method to create string

let email = new String("yaqoobahmed45700@gmail.com")
console.log(email); //[String: 'yaqoobahmed45700@gmail.com']
