Constructor Functions vs. Plain Objects

In JavaScript, objects can be created using constructor functions or plain object literals ({}). Here's why new is not suitable for creating instances of plain objects like cat in your example:

Constructor Functions:
Constructor functions are functions explicitly designed to initialize objects using this.

When you use new with a constructor function (new Constructor()), JavaScript:
Creates a new object.

Sets the prototype of the new object to Constructor.prototype.
Binds this to the new object within the constructor function.
Implicitly returns the new object unless another object is explicitly returned.

Plain Objects:
Plain objects in JavaScript are created using object literals ({}) or with Object.create(proto) to specify their prototype.
Plain objects do not have the necessary constructor logic (this binding, initialization logic) required by new.

Why new Doesn't Work with Plain Objects
When you attempt to use new with a plain object like cat, JavaScript expects cat to be a constructor function with the appropriate initialization logic using this. Since cat is defined as {} or Object.create(null), it lacks the necessary structure and behavior for new to function correctly.

Why Use Object.create() Instead
Object.create(proto) is designed specifically for creating objects with specified prototypes. Here's why it's preferred for prototype-based inheritance with plain objects:

Explicit Prototype Setting: Object.create(proto) clearly sets the prototype of the new object to proto.
No Confusion with Constructors: There's no ambiguity or expectation of constructor behavior (this binding, initialization) when using Object.create().
Clear Intent: Using Object.create() explicitly communicates that you're creating an object that inherits from another object (proto).
